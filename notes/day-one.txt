Things to do:
close read the GUI
close read the terminal

Things to make sure you say:
$ means you're typing in terminal. >>> means Python
Spaces and capitalization are meaningful
The up arrow will generally pull up your last command
Terminal and your GUI are related â€“ if you make a file in terminal it will show up in the finder and vice versa.
Command vs parameters

Things to have them do - make a text file on their desktop
make some files
make a folder - put some files into it
ls and pwd for life
delete that folder
