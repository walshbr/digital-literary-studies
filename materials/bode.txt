The Equivalence of “Close” and “Distant” Reading; or, Toward a New Object for Data-Rich Literary History
Katherine Bode
Abstract The approaches to data-rich literary history that dominate academic and public debate—Franco Moretti’s “distant reading” and Matthew Jockers’s “macroanalysis”—model literary systems in limited, abstract, and often ahistorical ways. This problem arises from neglect of the activities and insights of textual scholarship and is inherited from, rather than opposed to, the New Criticism and its core method of “close reading.” Literary history requires not new or integrated methods but a new scholarly object capable of managing the documentary record’s complexity, especially as manifested in emerging digital knowledge infrastructure. Building on significant, though uneven and unacknowledged, departures from Moretti’s and Jockers’s work in data-rich literary history, this essay describes such an object, modeled on the foundational technology of textual scholarship: the scholarly edition.

In a blog post Ted Underwood (2015) describes as “malarkey” “the version of distant reading currently circulating in [the] public imag- ination”: namely, that it analyzes “a massive database that includes ‘everything that has been thought and said.’” He continues: “In the early days of distant reading, Franco Moretti did frame the project as a chal- lenge to literary historians’ claims about synchronic coverage. (We only discuss a tiny number of books from any given period—what about all the rest?) But even in those early publications, Moretti acknowledged that we would only be able to represent ‘all the rest’ through some kind of sample.” Underwood is correct in a narrow sense: Moretti engages in, and occasionally acknowledges the practice of, data sampling. But it does not follow that the public imagination, or the mainstream media outlets
